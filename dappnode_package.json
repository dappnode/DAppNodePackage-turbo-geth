  "shortDescription": "Turbo-Geth is a fork of Go-Ethereum with focus on performance.",
  "description": "Alternative implementation of Ethereum (Eth 1.x), derived from go-ethereum. The main difference between turbo-geth and go-ethereum is in the way the database is used to store and access the Ethereum state and its history. This change has a profound effect on many parts of the code. Currently, turbo-geth only supports full sync from genesis block, but it will support snapshot sync which is more efficient than fast sync and more secure than warp sync. Turbo-geth is also used as a platform for the research into Stateless Ethereum.",
